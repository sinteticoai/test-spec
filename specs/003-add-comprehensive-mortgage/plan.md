# Implementation Plan: Comprehensive Mortgage Calculator Factors

**Branch**: `003-add-comprehensive-mortgage` | **Date**: 2025-10-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/Users/cristian/Apps/test-spec/specs/003-add-comprehensive-mortgage/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   â†’ Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   â†’ Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   â†’ If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   â†’ If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 â†’ research.md
   â†’ If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 â†’ contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   â†’ If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 â†’ Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Extend the existing Next.js mortgage calculator to include comprehensive factors missing from the current implementation: property price with down payment (percentage/dollar sync), discount/origination points with rate buydown, detailed closing costs breakdown, PMI calculation with automatic removal at 78% LTV, extra payment strategies (monthly/annual/lump-sum/bi-weekly), and ARM loan configuration. This transforms the basic calculator into a production-ready tool for home buyers to compare complete loan scenarios with accurate upfront costs and payment schedules.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, React 19, Next.js 15.5.4
**Primary Dependencies**: React 19, Next.js App Router, Radix UI (label, separator, collapsible), Tailwind CSS 4, Zod 4.1.11, class-variance-authority
**Storage**: Client-side state only (useState/useMemo) - no persistence
**Testing**: Jest 30.2.0, React Testing Library 16.3.0, @testing-library/jest-dom 6.9.1
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Next.js SSR + client hydration), Turbopack for dev/build
**Project Type**: Single web application (Next.js App Router with src/ structure)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms input responsiveness, instant calculation updates, smooth bi-directional sync for down payment fields
**Constraints**: Client-side only calculations (no API), must handle 360 monthly amortization entries efficiently, PMI calculations must follow federal standards (78% LTV)
**Scale/Scope**: 2-loan comparison interface, 38 functional requirements, 6 new entity types, estimated 15-20 new input fields across collapsible sections

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Component Architecture âœ…
- **Server Components by default**: Input forms require interactivity â†’ mark as 'use client' (existing pattern)
- **Single responsibility**: Each new section (down payment, points, closing costs, PMI, extra payments, ARM) gets dedicated component
- **200 line limit**: Current loan-input-form.tsx is ~150 lines with 7 fields. Adding 15-20 fields requires extraction into collapsible sub-components
- **No prop drilling**: Use composition pattern - pass callbacks directly to sections
- **Independently testable**: Each calculation function and sub-component isolated

### Server-First Pattern âœ…
- **Data fetching**: N/A - all calculations are client-side
- **Server Actions**: N/A - no mutations or persistence
- **Client Components**: All form components require 'use client' for useState/onChange handlers
- **Caching**: N/A - no external data fetching

### Type Safety (NON-NEGOTIABLE) âœ…
- **No `any` types**: Existing code uses explicit types (LoanInputs, LoanResults, AmortizationEntry)
- **Explicit types**: Must extend LoanInputs interface with new fields, create types for ClosingCosts, PMIConfig, ExtraPayments, ARMConfig
- **Zod validation**: Zod 4.1.11 already installed - extend LoanInputsSchema with new field validations
- **Generic types**: Use generic types for calculation functions
- **Type errors**: Must resolve before commits (existing npm run build requirement)

### Code Organization âœ…
- **Route structure**: Existing /app structure unchanged - all work in src/components/features and src/lib
- **Component separation**: /ui for FormattedInput (already done), /features for loan forms
- **Utilities**: src/lib/mortgage-calculator.ts extends with new calculation functions
- **Type definitions**: src/types/loan.ts extends with new interfaces
- **Co-location**: Keep component tests alongside components

### Performance & Optimization âœ…
- **Images**: N/A - calculator has no images
- **Fonts**: Already using Geist font via next/font
- **Dynamic imports**: Not needed - components are small and critical to initial render
- **Static/dynamic rendering**: All pages are client-interactive (Calculator requires user input)
- **Metadata**: Not applicable to internal components

**Verdict**: All constitutional requirements satisfied. No violations detected.

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js project with App Router. All feature work happens in `src/components/features` and `src/lib`. Type extensions in `src/types`. Existing architecture supports this expansion without structural changes.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION â†’ research task
   - For each dependency â†’ best practices task
   - For each integration â†’ patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** â†’ `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action â†’ endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story â†’ integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:

The /tasks command will generate a dependency-ordered task list following TDD principles:

1. **Type System Tasks** (Foundation - can run in parallel):
   - Extend `LoanInputs` interface with new fields (propertyPrice, downPayment, points, etc.)
   - Create `ClosingCosts` interface
   - Create `PMIConfig` interface with discriminated union for type
   - Create `ExtraPayments` interface
   - Create `ARMConfig` interface
   - Extend `LoanResults` interface with new calculated fields
   - Extend `AmortizationEntry` interface with PMI and extra payment tracking

2. **Validation Tasks** (Depends on types):
   - Extend Zod `LoanInputsSchema` with new field validations
   - Create `ClosingCostsSchema`
   - Create `PMIConfigSchema` with conditional validation
   - Create `ExtraPaymentsSchema`
   - Create `ARMConfigSchema`

3. **Contract Test Tasks** (Depends on types - TDD approach):
   - Write failing tests for `calculateEffectiveRate()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculatePointsCost()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculateTotalClosingCosts()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculateCashAtClosing()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculateLTV()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculateMonthlyPMI()`
   - Write failing tests for `findPMIRemovalMonth()`
   - Write failing tests for `recalculateWithExtraPayments()`
   - Write failing tests for `generateARMProjections()`
   - Write failing tests for `syncDownPayment()`
   - Write failing tests for `calculateComprehensiveLoanResults()`

4. **Calculation Implementation Tasks** (Make tests pass):
   - Implement `calculateEffectiveRate()`
   - Implement `calculatePointsCost()`
   - Implement `calculateTotalClosingCosts()`
   - Implement `calculateCashAtClosing()`
   - Implement `calculateLTV()`
   - Implement `calculateMonthlyPMI()`
   - Implement `findPMIRemovalMonth()`
   - Implement `recalculateWithExtraPayments()`
   - Implement `generateARMProjections()`
   - Implement `syncDownPayment()`
   - Implement `calculateComprehensiveLoanResults()` (integrates all functions)

5. **UI Component Refactor Tasks** (Depends on calculations):
   - Extract down payment section component from loan-input-form
   - Extract points & fees section component
   - Extract closing costs section component (with collapsible)
   - Extract PMI configuration section component (conditional)
   - Extract extra payments section component (with collapsible)
   - Extract ARM configuration section component (conditional)
   - Refactor loan-input-form to compose all sections (keep under 200 lines)
   - Update loan-comparison state management for new fields
   - Update loan-results to display closing costs breakdown
   - Update loan-results to display PMI removal information
   - Update loan-results to display extra payment savings
   - Update loan-results to display ARM projections
   - Update amortization-schedule to show PMI column
   - Update amortization-schedule to show extra payments column
   - Update amortization-schedule to show ARM rate changes

6. **Integration Test Tasks** (Validate acceptance scenarios):
   - Integration test: Scenario 1 - Property Price and Down Payment
   - Integration test: Scenario 2 - Using Points to Buy Down Rate
   - Integration test: Scenario 3 - Lender Credits Reducing Closing Costs
   - Integration test: Scenario 4 - PMI Calculation and Removal
   - Integration test: Scenario 5 - Extra Monthly Payments
   - Integration test: Scenario 6 - Bi-weekly Payment Strategy
   - Integration test: Scenario 7 - Comprehensive Closing Costs
   - Integration test: Scenario 8 - ARM Loan Configuration

7. **Quality & Validation Tasks**:
   - Run full test suite (npm test)
   - Run build verification (npm run build)
   - Run linting (npm run lint)
   - Manual quickstart validation (follow quickstart.md)
   - Performance validation (<100ms for calculations)

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase 1 (Types & Validation)**: All tasks can run in parallel [P]
- **Phase 2 (Contract Tests)**: All tasks can run in parallel [P] after Phase 1
- **Phase 3 (Calculations)**: Some parallel, some sequential:
  - Basic calculations [P]: effectiveRate, pointsCost, LTV, cashAtClosing
  - Advanced calculations: PMI functions after LTV
  - Amortization extensions: extraPayments and ARM after basic calculations
  - Comprehensive function: Last, integrates all others
- **Phase 4 (UI Components)**: Section extractions [P], then form composition, then results updates
- **Phase 5 (Integration Tests)**: Can run in parallel [P] after implementation complete
- **Phase 6 (Quality)**: Sequential, run in order

**Dependency Markers**:
- `[P]` = Can run in parallel (no dependencies within phase)
- `[D: task-X]` = Depends on task X completing first
- `[GATE]` = All previous tasks must pass before proceeding

**Estimated Output**: ~50-55 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Task Granularity**:
- Each task represents 15-30 minutes of focused work
- Complex components split into subtasks (extract â†’ compose â†’ test)
- Contract tests separate from implementations (TDD workflow)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
