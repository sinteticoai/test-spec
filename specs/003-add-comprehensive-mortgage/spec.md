### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should users enter down payment? ‚Üí A: Both percentage and dollar amount with automatic synchronization
- Q: At what LTV percentage should PMI automatically terminate? ‚Üí A: 78% LTV (federal standard for conventional loans)
- Q: How much should each discount point reduce the interest rate? ‚Üí A: Fixed 0.25% per point (industry standard approximation)
- Q: How many payments per year should bi-weekly payment option generate? ‚Üí A: 26 payments (true bi-weekly: every 2 weeks)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a home buyer, I want to accurately calculate my total monthly mortgage payment and upfront costs by entering all relevant factors (property price, down payment, points, closing costs, PMI options, and payment acceleration strategies), so that I can make informed decisions when comparing different loan scenarios.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Property Price and Down Payment**
1. **Given** I'm evaluating a $700,000 property, **When** I enter property price and 20% down payment, **Then** system calculates loan amount as $560,000 and shows no PMI required

**Scenario 2: Using Points to Buy Down Rate**
2. **Given** I have a 6% interest rate quote, **When** I purchase 1 discount point (1% of loan amount), **Then** my interest rate adjusts lower and monthly payment decreases, while closing costs increase

**Scenario 3: Lender Credits Reducing Closing Costs**
3. **Given** I have $5,000 in closing costs, **When** I apply $2,000 in lender credits, **Then** my upfront cash needed decreases by $2,000

**Scenario 4: PMI Calculation and Removal**
4. **Given** I put down 15% (85% LTV), **When** system calculates monthly PMI based on PMI rate, **Then** PMI is included in monthly payment and system shows when PMI will automatically terminate at 78% LTV

**Scenario 5: Extra Monthly Payments**
5. **Given** I have a 30-year mortgage, **When** I add $200 extra monthly payment, **Then** system shows reduced loan term and total interest savings

**Scenario 6: Bi-weekly Payment Strategy**
6. **Given** I select bi-weekly payment option, **When** system recalculates schedule, **Then** I make 26 payments per year (every 2 weeks) totaling 13 monthly payments annually, and payoff timeline accelerates

**Scenario 7: Comprehensive Closing Costs**
7. **Given** I enter all closing cost line items, **When** I view results, **Then** system shows total cash needed at closing including down payment and all fees

**Scenario 8: ARM Loan Configuration**
8. **Given** I select an ARM loan type, **When** I configure initial rate period and adjustment caps, **Then** system shows payment schedule with future rate adjustments

### Edge Cases
- What happens when down payment exceeds 20% and PMI is not required?
- How does system handle when seller concessions exceed actual closing costs?
- What if lender credits exceed closing costs?
- How does system calculate PMI for down payments between 3-20%?
- What happens when extra payments cause loan to be paid off early?
- How does system display amortization when bi-weekly payments are selected?
- When down payment fields show both percentage and dollar, changing one immediately updates the other
