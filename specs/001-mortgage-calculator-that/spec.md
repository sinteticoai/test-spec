## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A homebuyer or homeowner wants to compare two different mortgage loan options to determine which offers better terms. They need to input the details of each loan (principal, interest rate, loan term, and optionally other costs) and see a clear comparison of monthly payments, total interest paid, and total cost over the life of each loan.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have details for two mortgage loans, **When** I enter the principal amount, interest rate, and loan term for both loans, **Then** I see calculated monthly payment, total interest, and total cost for each loan side by side
2. **Given** I have entered valid loan details, **When** I modify any input field, **Then** the calculations update automatically to reflect the new values
3. **Given** I enter invalid data (negative numbers, non-numeric values, or zero term length), **When** I attempt to view results, **Then** I see clear error messages indicating what needs to be corrected
4. **Given** I have entered loan details in different formats (e.g., interest rate as 5 vs 5% vs 0.05), **When** the system processes my input, **Then** it correctly interprets and normalizes the values for calculation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when interest rate is 0%?
- What happens when one loan field is incomplete but the other is fully filled?
- How does the system handle very large loan amounts (e.g., $10M+ commercial properties)?
- How does the system handle very long loan terms (e.g., 40+ years)?
- What precision is used for currency display (cents vs. whole dollars)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to input loan details for two separate mortgages
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept the following inputs for each loan: principal amount, annual interest rate, and loan term in years
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate and display monthly payment amount for each loan
- **FR-004**: System MUST calculate and display total interest paid over the life of each loan
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate and display total amount paid over the life of each loan
- **FR-006**: System MUST present both loans side by side for easy comparison
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate input values to ensure they are positive numbers [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are acceptable ranges - minimum/maximum loan amounts, interest rates, and terms?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages when invalid data is entered
- **FR-009**: System MUST update calculations in real-time as users modify inputs [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should calculations update on every keystroke or when user leaves a field?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the calculator support additional costs like property taxes, insurance, HOA fees, or PMI?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to save or export comparison results?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the calculator show an amortization schedule or just summary totals?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to compare different loan types (fixed vs. ARM, 30-year vs. 15-year), or is this purely for comparing terms?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What currency should be supported - USD only or multi-currency?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be any user authentication or can anyone access the calculator anonymously?]

### Key Entities
- **Loan**: Represents a mortgage loan with principal amount, annual interest rate, loan term in years, calculated monthly payment, total interest, and total cost
- **Comparison**: Represents the side-by-side view of two loans showing their respective calculations and differences
