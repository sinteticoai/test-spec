## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: How should users specify their marginal tax rate for benefit calculations? ‚Üí A: System calculates based on user-entered income (requires income input field)
- Q: Which filing status options should the system support for tax calculations? ‚Üí A: Support all four: Single, Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Head of Household
- Q: Should the system include state-level tax benefits or only federal calculations? ‚Üí A: Federal only - simpler, no state selection needed
- Q: Should the system compare total itemized deductions against the standard deduction to determine if itemizing is beneficial? ‚Üí A: Yes - calculate both scenarios and show which is better for the user
- Q: How should users provide property tax information for the calculations? ‚Üí A: User enters estimated annual property taxes directly

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a homeowner or prospective homebuyer using the mortgage calculator, I want to see the tax benefits I might receive from my mortgage so that I can understand the true monthly cost after tax savings and make informed financial decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has entered valid mortgage details (loan amount, interest rate, term), annual income, filing status, and estimated annual property taxes, **When** the user views the results, **Then** a tax benefits section appears above the amortization schedule showing estimated annual and monthly tax savings calculated using their income-derived tax bracket
2. **Given** a user views the tax benefits section, **When** tax deductions are calculated, **Then** the system displays mortgage interest deduction and property tax deduction separately with clear explanations
3. **Given** a user sees monthly payment information, **When** tax benefits are applied, **Then** the system shows the effective monthly payment after accounting for tax savings
4. **Given** a user inputs mortgage details, income, filing status, and property taxes, **When** calculating tax benefits, **Then** the system applies 2025 federal tax code rules accurately including automatic tax bracket determination based on filing status
5. **Given** a user selects a different filing status, **When** recalculating, **Then** tax bracket thresholds and standard deduction amounts adjust according to the selected status
6. **Given** itemized deductions are calculated, **When** compared to standard deduction, **Then** the system indicates which method is more beneficial and uses it for tax savings calculation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when mortgage interest deduction exceeds allowable limits under 2025 rules?
- How does the system handle scenarios where property taxes exceed the SALT deduction cap?
- What information is displayed when a user's mortgage doesn't qualify for tax benefits (e.g., loan exceeds $750,000 limit)?
- How are partial-year scenarios handled for the first year of mortgage?
- What is displayed when standard deduction exceeds itemized deductions (no tax benefit from itemizing)?
